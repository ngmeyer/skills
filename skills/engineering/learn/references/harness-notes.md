| PR metadata + comments | `gh pr view <n> --json body,comments,reviews,files` | same via terminal, or GitHub MCP | GitHub MCP (`get_pull_request`, `list_pull_request_comments`) | REST `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}` |
| open draft PR | `gh pr create --draft` | `gh` or GitHub MCP | GitHub MCP `create_pull_request` (draft) — needs user approval | push branch, open in UI |

| trigger post-merge | hook/manual `/learn` | manual or background agent | routine on merge or manual | GitHub Action on `pull_request: closed && merged` that posts "run learn" comment |
Claude Code: CLAUDE.md should `@AGENTS.md`-import so lessons load deterministically.
Cursor: rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` that point to topics count as context — grep them in dedupe.
