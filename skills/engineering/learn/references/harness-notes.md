# Harness notes (keep harness specifics here, not in SKILL.md)
| need | Claude Code | Cursor | Grok Bot | any |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| install | `.claude/skills/learn/` or plugin | `.cursor/skills/learn/` or rule pointing at SKILL.md | box skill dir / Skills | read SKILL.md as a prompt |
| PR metadata + comments | `gh pr view <n> --json body,comments,reviews,files` | same via terminal, or GitHub MCP | GitHub MCP (`get_pull_request`, `list_pull_request_comments`) | REST `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}` |
| open draft PR | `gh pr create --draft` | `gh` or GitHub MCP | GitHub MCP `create_pull_request` (draft) — needs user approval | push branch, open in UI |
| run verify.sh | Bash | terminal | Shell on box | bash |
| trigger post-merge | hook/manual `/learn` | manual or background agent | routine on merge or manual | GitHub Action on `pull_request: closed && merged` that posts "run learn" comment |
Claude Code: CLAUDE.md should `@AGENTS.md`-import so lessons load deterministically.
Cursor: rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` that point to topics count as context — grep them in dedupe.

## Memory locations for `from-memories` (read-only inputs)
| harness | global | per project | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-abs-path>/memory/*.md` (+ `MEMORY.md` index), repo `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md` | encoded path = absolute repo path with each non-alphanumeric char → `-`; `CLAUDE.local.md` is personal by convention → Not for repo |
| Cursor | User Rules (Settings → Rules; copy out as text) | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, legacy `.cursorrules`; Memories (Settings → Rules → Memories, export as text) | rules already in the repo are dedupe targets, not imports, unless the user names them |
| Grok Bot | memory export (plain text the user pastes or saves) | same export with a `project: <repo root>` first line, or saved inside the repo | treat unscoped exports as global |
| any | user-named `.md`/`.txt` | — | map by path/header; else global |
